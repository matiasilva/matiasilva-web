I'm Matias - an engineering student at Cambridge University, currently in my second year and set to graduate with a Master's in Engineering.

Though I'm "officially" an engineering ugrad, my interests are varied ranging from software development and deployment, Linux sysadmining, embedded systems, cooking and linguistics.

## What am I studying?

I'm an undergraduate student in the [Engineering Department](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge. I have recently finished my first year (1A).

The course is formally named *MEng Engineering* and it is an "integrated masters", which means that I’ll graduate with a Master’s in Engineering (MEng) as well as the *Cambridge BA* that is conferred for all undergraduate courses. I will qualify for the BA after 3 years of study and plan to complete a fourth year to qualify for the MEng.

## A bit more about me

I was born in Stockholm and shortly after moved to 7 countries around the world while growing up. During this period of my life, which I owe a big chunk of my personality and core values to, I picked up 5 languages and traveled to over 40 countries. I believe strongly that everyone should learn at least two languages in their lifetimes and immerse themselves in the amazing cultures of this world.

As of Nov 2020, a few things I do are:

I find plenty of ways to distract myself. Here are a few of them:

* I'm a volunteer of the [Student-Run Computing Facility](https://www.srcf.net/) where I move money around as [treasurer](https://www.srcf.net/committee), manage our [free video conferencing](https://timeout.srcf.net/) and work on many other projects
* I'm a weekend chef at [FoodCycle Cambridge](https://www.foodcycle.org.uk/location/cambridge/)
* I am webmaster for [CU First-Aid Society](https://firstaid.soc.srcf.net/) and [CU Synthetic Biology Society](http://cusbs.soc.srcf.net/)
* As if those weren't enough to keep my Director of Studies worried, I'm also secretary and webmaster of the [CU Portuguese Society](https://cupor.soc.srcf.net/)
