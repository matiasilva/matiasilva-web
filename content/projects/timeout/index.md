For my work on Timeout, I was [given an award](https://www.cctl.cam.ac.uk/oscea/winners-2020/edwin-matias) by my University, signed by the Pro-Vice Chancellor for Education.

I've written two blog posts on Timeout, one on [its historical origins](https://blog.srcf.net/posts/timeout/) and another on [its technical aspects](https://blog.srcf.net/posts/timeout-diy/).

I recently wrote a WSGI frontend to interact with the BigBlueButton API called [LightBlueTent](https://github.com/SRCF/lightbluetent/). This is written in Flask and has a proper Docker development environment. It hosted four society fairs, including part of the Cambridge SU's fair.

I'm also working on a load balancer for BigBlueButton written with FastAPI to improve the current one we're using, which is written in Ruby (yo no comprendo).
