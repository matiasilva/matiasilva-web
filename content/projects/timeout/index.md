For my work on Timeout, I was [given an award](https://www.cctl.cam.ac.uk/oscea/winners-2020/edwin-matias) by my University, signed by the Pro-Vice Chancellor for Education.

I've written two blog posts on Timeout, one on [its historical origins](https://blog.srcf.net/posts/timeout/) and another on [its technical aspects](https://blog.srcf.net/posts/timeout-diy/).
