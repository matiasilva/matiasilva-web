It&amp;rsquo;s a curious topic for many, and I can&amp;rsquo;t blame them for it! I would&amp;rsquo;ve equally wanted to know more about applying in my younger days too.</description></item><item><title>Personal website</title><link>https://www.matiasilva.com/projects/website/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.matiasilva.com/projects/website/</guid><description/></item><item><title>CoderDojo LX</title><link>https://www.matiasilva.com/projects/coderdojolx/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.matiasilva.com/projects/coderdojolx/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Modelling of diseases</title><link>https://www.matiasilva.com/projects/sir-modelling/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.matiasilva.com/projects/sir-modelling/</guid><description>I was bored and in a world where doom and gloom were around me, so I decided to model that.

I&amp;rsquo;ve written two blog posts on Timeout, one on its historical origins and another on its technical aspects.
I recently wrote a WSGI frontend to interact with the BigBlueButton API called LightBlueTent.</description></item><item><title>SRCF Documentation</title><link>https://www.matiasilva.com/projects/srcf-docs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.matiasilva.com/projects/srcf-docs/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Assorted games</title><link>https://www.matiasilva.com/projects/other-games/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.matiasilva.com/projects/other-games/</guid><description>List of games A curated list of the games that made the cut (looking back at my 14-year-old self was tough!) is shown here:
