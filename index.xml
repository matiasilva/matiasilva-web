A lot of the inspiration for this came from a video I watched by 3Blue1Brown about modelling infectious diseases, like COVID-19.

Here&amp;rsquo;s another news post by the Engineering Department.
I&amp;rsquo;ve written two blog posts on Timeout, one on its historical origins and another on its technical aspects.
I recently wrote a WSGI frontend to interact with the BigBlueButton API called LightBlueTent. This is written in Flask and has a proper Docker development environment.</description></item><item><title>SRCF Documentation</title><link>https://www.matiasilva.com/projects/srcf-docs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.matiasilva.com/projects/srcf-docs/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Assorted games</title><link>https://www.matiasilva.com/projects/other-games/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.matiasilva.com/projects/other-games/</guid><description>List of games A curated list of the games that made the cut (looking back at my 14-year-old self was tough!) is shown here:
