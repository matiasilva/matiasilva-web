It&amp;rsquo;s a curious topic for many, and I can&amp;rsquo;t blame them for it! I would&amp;rsquo;ve equally wanted to know more about applying in my younger days too. Over the years, people have approached me for advice and what I did to &amp;ldquo;get in&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve collected a few of these replies and put them in this post, in the hopes that it may one day help someone!</description></item></channel></rss>
